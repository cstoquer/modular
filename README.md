# webAudio doodle

*Modular* is a cool interface to easily create and test webAudio routing configurations.
Similar to an analog modular synthesizer, you add *modules* in a *patch*.
A module can be a simple webAudio feature or a more complex configuration
and can holds some controls in the form of *knob*, *button*, etc.
Then, the modules can simply be connected together with cables.

UI is strongly influenced by Clavia's *Nord Modular*'s editor.
